# Exception Handling Proposal for WebAssembly

This repository holds a [proposal](proposals/exception-handling/Exceptions.md)
for adding exception handling to WebAssembly.

* See the [proposal overview](proposals/exception-handling/Exceptions.md) for a
summary of the proposal.

The repository is now based on the [reference types proposal](proposals/reference-types/Overview.md) and includes all respective changes.

Original README from upstream repository follows...

# spec

This repository holds a prototypical reference implementation for WebAssembly,
which is currently serving as the official specification. Eventually, we expect
to produce a specification either written in human-readable prose or in a formal
specification language.

It also holds the WebAssembly testsuite, which tests numerous aspects of
conformance to the spec.

View the work-in-progress spec at
[webassembly.github.io/spec](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/).

At this time, the contents of this repository are under development and known
to be "incomplet and inkorrect".

Participation is welcome. Discussions about new features, significant semantic
changes, or any specification change likely to generate substantial discussion
should take place in [the WebAssembly design
repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design) first, so that this spec
repository can remain focused. And please follow the [guidelines for
contributing](Contributing.md).
